# INFO201: Group 4 ReadMe

## Instructions (from Canvas Assignment Page):
**What exactly you build is up to your group, but it must meet the following requirements:** \
- Create an interactive visualization platform using R, compiled into a webpage for enhanced accessibility \
- Choose a dataset of sufficient complexity to explore. This doesn't mean it has to be Big Data, but it should either be of notable size (more than a few hundred observations), or complexity (more than ~5 features of each observation) \
- Demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the important features of the dataset. High-level insights (important descriptive information, major trends, notable outliers, etc.) should be prominent in your resource. Statistical analyses may be included if appropriate. \
- Devise a visual representation of your data (i.e., chart, map, etc.). Ideally, this should be an interactive visualization with ability to interact with the interface (hover, click, drag, etc.), or change the data being displayed (i.e., the chart responds to a set of controls, such as which data is being displayed) \
- Tailor your resource to a specific target audience. The way you frame your solution for a scientific versus general audience is quite different.

## Submission
